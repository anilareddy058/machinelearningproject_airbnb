Skyberry Farm's ""Feed the Need Program"" uses all funds from the BnB space to fund our farming operation, allowing Skyberry to donate all its produce to hunger relief agencies in the metro area.

There was no issue with noise from above.   The large apt looks exactly as the photos show.  Marina was easy to reach by text, and she always responded immediately to any questions.  The apt had nice decor and was well furnished.  We appreciated the basket of snacks, large selection of teas, and a variety of coffee.  (There was plenty of sugar and sweetner, but no creamer.)   The mattress in the 2nd bdrm was firm and very comfortable.  The mattress in the bdrm next to the bathroom however had a 2 1/2 inch piece of soft foam on the top of the mattress, which made it too soft and squishy for us, so it was not comfortable for our backs.  The recliner and sofa in the living room were very comfortable.  The remote-operated little stove in the living area  provided a warm, homey glow and a bit of warmth on the rainy nights.  Tip:  To turn on the tv and find Direct tv channels, use the small white remote rather than the other 2 black ones.  The refrigerator, induction burner, toaster oven, toaster, dishwasher, etc. all worked well, and the kitchen had plenty of dishes, pots and pans.  The side of the bathtub was rather high, and the rail along the side of the tub for the sliding glass shower door made it even higher, so it was difficult for us short people to safely climb over it for a shower.  Our 5 ft. son couldn't get into the tub at all.  The stone steps were exactly as Marina described, saying they were not for people with mobility issues.  We thought we could handle them easily, but being in our mid-70s and our son having special needs, they turned out to be a bit steep and somewhat challenging after all, especially in the rain and pulling luggage.  Younger people in good shape would have no trouble though.  The landscaping along the lighted path was beautiful.  The view of the woods behind the house was gorgeous and serene.

Prior to our arrival, Michelle was very helpful and easy to contact and communicate with.  The townhome was perfect for our needs and located in a beautiful part of Portland we'd never seen before.  Forest Heights is a great community, and we enjoyed the trails, greenery, and beautiful homes.  I was remote working for the entire month, and the loft office proved to be a perfect place for that.  Good strong wi-fi signals for those long Zoom meetings, followed by pleasant walks to Mill Pond Park with the dog.  The kitchen was great, and we actually hosted a few dinner parties with our Portland family.  The home is well furnished and maintained, very comfortable,  and a great deal for the price.

You can be assured that you will be well taken care of here. My extensive travels throughout the world and my experience hosting guests at one of the wests premiere hunting and fishing lodges can assure you an enjoyable and comfortable stay in Portland. Community is important to our city, for my neighborhood and myself. I am lucky to be in a neighborhood filled with wonderful small businesses and great people of all colors and professions.  In Portland, our community is your community. You just may end your travel wanting to stay right here and become a Portlandian. 

HOSTING/TRAVEL: I search to find those who point me in a safe direction and allow me to create my own adventure. I strive to do the same for others.

LIFE MOTTO:  While I don't live by one motto I do keep close the following advice I've been lucky to receive...
1. Life is always grey - don't live in the black and white..
2. Being compassionate, generous and open will move the world in wondrous ways.
3. Rules are meant to be blurred.
4. Keep your word. Authenticity is a rare and valued quality. Get it and keep it. 
5. Wear horizontal stripes and crazy socks. A natural mood elevator, they make people smile.

"Portland, Oregon, United States",$153 ,USD,nightly,"I love living in this North Portland neighborhood developed to house shipyard workers in the 1940's.  My neighborhoods industrial and industrious roots have served it well as the Portland Metro region has evolved, emerged and expanded.  Sometimes especially late at night,  I hear the tug boats sound off, below me on the Willamette as they maneuver enormous ships, from world-wide ports, to and from docks on Swan Island or the last whistle of a train as it disappears into ""the cut"",  a tunnel built 100' below ground to move freight  without disturbing blissfully unaware sleeping residents high above.   Living here today is to experience daily an edgy blend of grit and comforts, a nicely balanced bit of nature and urban lifestyle -  all this makes for a very interesting place to call home or visit!  

 I volunteer and support local non-profit organizations working to ensure the humane treatment of outside animals living in urban areas  including following Feral Cat Coalition of Oregon guidelines.

When I'm not at home in Portland - 
My career was built built on a passion for producing outdoor live music events - especially those that are led by volunteers to benefit non-profit organizations.  Now that I'm freed up from full-time commitments  you're more likely to find me helping colleagues put on festivals and events in other parts of the US and Canada or visiting family and friends on the East Coast and other parts of the world.

Growing up in California and traveling in several countries has exposed me to the cultural diversity of how food is expressed, and I take great joy and care in bringing that diversity to Portland.  

Most places I've traveled to were tropical.  Mexico, Costa Rica, Hawaii, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand and India.  But for me, culinary diversity starts in the U.S.  The Mid-West to the South and up and down the Western Seaboard as well as choice places in the East Coast have all been a delicious delight!  And I enjoy bringing those flavors to Portland in my teaching and my menus.

I have experienced many styles of traveling from camping, family stays, traditional B&B's, and luxury accommodations.  Those that stand out greatly are the stories of the people that I connected with while traveling. Those spaces made those stories possible.

I live in Portland with my wife, Faith, and our son, Waylon. We only recently moved to the great, old school neighborhood of St. Johns. We love to have visitors, guest artists, friends and family members come to stay with us.  We try to host parties when we can, and keep the house buzzing and doors open.

I've had the great joy of traveling and doing theatre/artistic work in Eastern/Central Europe, Mexico, the Balkans and Turkey.  We've also camped across as much of the US as we can, even crossing coast-to-coast via Amtrak on a loooong trip.  And we've begun to steadily try and see every mountain range on the west coast in summer camping trips from the Canadian border down to California.

Favorite trips have been the times we stayed for a month or more with our friends in their homes (Mexico City, Szamocin Poland) and got to know their real way of life, meet their families and friends, and eventually take part in festivals, birthdays, celebrations, road trips, adventures and family dinners.

My favorite way to travel is to show up without much of a plan and learn from the people I meet where we should really go, and what to see, and the best ways to travel and the foods I've never heard of... to really discover something different than I ever knew before I left.

Vacation Home Management

Vacasa unlocks the possibilities of how we enjoy vacation homes. We take care of managing our homeowners’ vacation houses so they can have peace of mind (and their home when they want to). And our guests book vacations confidently knowing they’re going to find exactly what they’re looking for without any surprises.

Each vacation home is always cared for by our professional local teams who implement our high cleanliness and maintenance values, while the hands-off tasks of vacation rental management--marketing, filing taxes, and maintaining a website--are handled by a specialized central support team. Our passion and focus remain true: to empower our homeowners, guests, and employees to invest in vacation.","10,363 Reviews",Identity verified,Vacasa Oregon,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/145210319,145210319,FALSE,100%,within an hour,Vacasa Oregon,Alok,75299354,"Honestly, I don't like to leave bad reviews for places that I have Airbnb'd  before, but this was a bad experience.

The beds were not ready, were missing linens, and also, there was toilet paper missing from certain bathrooms. Soaps and shampoos were scattered across the house. We had to look for things for the most part. They were still cleaning well past 5 pm. There were fake eyelashes found on the floor in one of the rooms later that nigh, and hair was also present on some of the bedsheets (the one's that actually had them). We were told by the cleaning staff around 5:25 pm (check in was supposed to be at 4:00 pm), that they would wash some of the missing linens and bring them back.
